### User asked:

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

### Criteria:

*GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
*WHEN I search for a city
*THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
*WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
*THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
*WHEN I view the UV index
*THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
*WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
*THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
*WHEN I click on a city in the search history
*THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

### What was done.

The criteria given by the user/client was met/ Using JavaScript and Jquerry to run and obtain data from OpenWeather's API.
The date displayed is:
*Temperture
*Humidity
*Wind Speed
*UV Index

Also a 5 day forcast for the searched city is shown and a quick launch of popular cities.
